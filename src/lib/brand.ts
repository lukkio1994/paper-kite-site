Unfortunately, your lair has become way too popular with overeager heroes looking for glory (and your stuff). You never asked for this‚Äîso it's time to set traps, rearrange rooms, and spend precious mana to send them packing.";

In this single-player strategy game, you'll outsmart hero parties with clever tricks, improvisation, and a touch of dark humor as you turn their epic quests into slapstick disasters. Build your lair, bait the heroes, and watch their plans fall apart in glorious chaos. You might be outpowered, but you're never outwitted. Again, get out‚Äîthis is not a dungeon.";
